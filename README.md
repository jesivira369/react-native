# Goal List App

## Introduction

Welcome to my first React Native app! This project is a simple Goal List application developed entirely in JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, and delete goals or tasks they want to achieve. The primary aim of this app is to provide a hands-on learning experience with React Native and to serve as a foundation for future mobile app development projects.

## Features

- **Add Goals**: Users can input their goals using a modal form.
- **View Goals**: Goals are displayed in a scrollable list.
- **Delete Goals**: Users can delete goals by pressing on the goal item.
- **Stylish UI**: The app features a modern and clean user interface.
